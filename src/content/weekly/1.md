Hello! You are reading the first post of Zihan Weekly ever. I just launched this weekly and I just call it Zihan Weekly. I will share the latest and high qualified stuff about web development in this weekly, including links to articles, new libraries or frameworks and everything related to web dev. I will also write my own thoughts about web development here. For example, I may write a tutorial of creating a cool animation here, as a part of the body of the weekly.

This weekly is only about web development, which includes things like HTML, CSS, JS, but sometimes also some backend stuff. It's focusing more on fullstack development, meaning that it's not just about JavaScript, not just about CSS, not just about Node.js, but everything associated to web dev. I'm kind of repeating myself, saying "web dev" again and again. So let's define this phrase `web dev` - everything you may need to build a website or a web app.
