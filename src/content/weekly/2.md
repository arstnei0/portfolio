TypeScript is amazing. The flexibility its type system is providing is just so powerful and I just noticed a project call [HOTScript](https://github.com/gvergnaud/HOTScript) (Higher-Order TypeScript) which allows us to make type-level functions. What does this mean? Let's see how we can use it.

```ts
const str = "10"
type n = Call<Strings.ToNumber, typeof str>
//   ^ = 10
```

Too simple? Let's look at another more complex one:

```ts
type shouldBeNinetyFive = Pipe<
	//  ^ = 95
	[1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4],
	[
		Tuples.Map<Numbers.Add<3>>,
		Strings.Join<".">,
		Strings.Split<".">,
		Tuples.Map<Strings.ToNumber>,
		Tuples.Map<Numbers.Add<10>>,
		Tuples.Sum
	]
>
```

Yes, we are using functions in TypeScript! This looks so cool. But how does it works under the hood?

We have a interface `Fn` which has some args and an output type, plus a `Call` type:

```ts
interface Fn {
	_args: unknown[]
	output: unknown
	args: this["_args"] extends unknown[] & infer args extends any[]
		? args
		: never
}

type Call<fn extends Fn, args> = (fn & {
	_args: args
})["output"]
```

Just try to understand the code. The `_args` and `args` are just a trick that makes sure the args are what we are passing into it, without `unknown[]`.

And here are two `Fn`s implemented:

```ts
interface Join extends Fn {
	output: [...this["args"][0], ...this["args"][1]]
}

interface StringToNumber extends Fn {
	output: this["args"][0] extends `${infer n extends number}` ? n : never
}
```

Each of the functions takes the `args` provided and gives an output type. Now we can use these two type-level functions like this:

```ts
const a = ["Hello"] as const
const b = ["world"] as const
type joined = Call<Join, [typeof a, typeof b]>
//   ^ = ["Hello", "world"]

const str = "35"
type n = Call<StringToNumber, [typeof str]>
//   ^ = 35
```

It's working! Now we can try to define more and more `Fn`s to implement more and more type-level functions. Here are some examples:

```ts

```
