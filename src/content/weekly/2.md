TypeScript is amazing. The flexibility its type system is providing is just so powerful and I just noticed a project call [HOTScript](https://github.com/gvergnaud/HOTScript) (Higher-Order TypeScript) which allows us to make type-level functions. What does this mean? Let's see how we can use it.

```ts
const str = "10"
type n = Call<Strings.ToNumber, typeof str>
//   ^ = 10
```

Too simple? Let's look at another more complex one:

```ts
type shouldBeNinetyFive = Pipe<
	//  ^ = 95
	[1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4],
	[
		Tuples.Map<Numbers.Add<3>>,
		Strings.Join<".">,
		Strings.Split<".">,
		Tuples.Map<Strings.ToNumber>,
		Tuples.Map<Numbers.Add<10>>,
		Tuples.Sum
	]
>
```
